First, you'll need to set up git and docker.<br>

Now create a directory and clone the project repository.<br>
  creating a directory:<br>
    $ mkdir <dir_name><br>

  go to the directory you just created:<br>
    $ cd path/to/your/dir<br>
  
  clone the repository:<br>
    $ git clone https://github.com/harigot/welcome-to-the-django.git<br>
   
  enter the repository directory:<br>
    $ cd welcome-to-the-django<br>

And finally, you just build the image and run the container.<br>
