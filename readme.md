This project is a way to demonstrate the skills I'm learning as a web developer. I'm still working on some features and learning a lot on this project (much more than I anticipated), so please feel free to give your feedback, any tips are welcome.

## how to run this project
<pre>
First, you'll need to set up git and docker.
  setting up git:
    https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git
    
  setting up docker:
    https://www.docker.com/get-started/

Now create a directory and clone the project repository.
  creating a directory:
    $ mkdir <dir_name>

  go to the directory you just created:
    $ cd path/to/your/dir
  
  clone the repository:
    $ git clone https://github.com/harigot/welcome-to-the-django.git
   
  enter the repository directory:
    $ cd welcome-to-the-django

And finally, you just build the image and run the container.
  building docker image:
    $ docker-compose build
    
  run the image:
    $ docker-compose up

In your browser, type de link with was specified on the terminal.
(normally is http://0.0.0.0:8000/)

Thanks for giving hyperdrated a try, if you are starting out as a web developer
feel free to play around with the code and use it in your studies.
